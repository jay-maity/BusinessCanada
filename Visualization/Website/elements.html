								<h2>Why invest in Canada?</h2>
								<p><strong>Canada</strong> is politically very stable. Its budget deficit is moderate relative to any other jurisdiction. The balance-of payments deficit is also small, with its most important trading partner as the United States, followed by China and Mexico. Canada enjoys a large surplus in its trade with the U.S. Canada faces very little inflation risk since the country has maintained a sound monetary policy.</p>
